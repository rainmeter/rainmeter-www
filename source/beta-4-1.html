    <h1 class="text-center">Rainmeter 4.1</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The following are the changes for the 4.1 beta version of Rainmeter. You can safely install the new 4.1 beta version right over top of your existing Rainmeter 4.0 or earlier installation, and nothing you have done will be lost or changed. There is never any need to uninstall any earlier version of Rainmeter to use the newest version.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> As of Rainmeter 4.0, Windows XP and Windows Vista are no longer supported by the application.</p>
    <p>Rainmeter 4.0 and later require at least Windows 7 with <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-windows-7-service-pack-1">Service Pack 1</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36805">Platform Update</a> applied. These should have been automatically applied several years ago by Windows Update, but if you have Windows Update turned off you may need to get and apply these updates manually. Windows versions later than Windows 7 are fully supported.</p>
    <p>If you are on Windows XP or Windows Vista, and can't or don't wish to upgrade, you will need to stay on the 3.3 Release version of Rainmeter.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="badge badge-added">Added</span> <span class="change-text"><b>Rainmeter plugins:</b> Added the ability to create plugins in C++ or C# supporting Inline Plugin Section Variables in a skin. This is primarily a change for plugin authors, with any documentation for how their plugins should be used in a skin provided by the author. Details on how this can be used in a plugin are at <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/developers/plugin/cpp/#Custom">C++</a> and <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/developers/plugin/csharp/#Custom">C#</a>.</span></li>
			<li><span class="badge badge-changed">Changed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>Rainmeter plugins:</b> The Plugin API has been updated to support Inline Plugin Section Variables. In addition, the documentation for plugin authors has been greatly enhanced and improved, and new and improved example plugins added to the SDK. Plugin authors are strongly encouraged to get the latest <a href="https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter-plugin-sdk">Plugin SDK</a> and review the new <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/developers/">Developer Documentation</a>.</span></li>
			<li><span class="badge badge-changed">Changed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>Illustro default skins:</b> Changed the URL used to get the user's WAN IP address in the Network skin in Illustro. Note that Illustro will not be installed or updated on existing Rainmeter installations, only on new installations, and this change should be manually made if Illustro is currently being used.</span></li>
			<li><span class="badge badge-changed">Changed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>Lua scripting:</b> Corrected an issue where the GetOption() function referencing meters in the skin were not seeing options set by a MeterStyle.</span></li>
			<li><span class="badge badge-changed">Changed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>About dialog:</b> The Plugins tab in the About dialog will now group the plugins as "External" or "Built-in".</span></li>
			<li><span class="badge badge-changed">Changed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>About dialog:</b> Added a right-click context menu to copy the value of Variables in the Skins tab.</span></li>
      <li><span class="badge badge-fixed">Fixed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>Rainmeter:</b> Corrected a bug that was not properly resolving variables using the new nesting syntax in some cases.</span></li>
      <li><span class="badge badge-fixed">Fixed</span> <span class="change-text"><b>Rainmeter Installer:</b> Corrected an issue where the AudioLevel plugin was still being treated as an external plugin, and needlessly copied to the Rainmeter program folder.</span></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>Additional note, and a request...</b></p>
		<p>Recent additions and changes in the user interface for Rainmeter will require new "translations" to the various user languages supported. Many of these changes have been made, and are included in this beta. However, there are languages that still require some work, and we depend on the user community to provide these translations. Please see <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/localization-help">How to help localize Rainmeter</a> to get involved.</p>

      <li><span class="badge badge-fixed">Fixed</span><b>Bitmap meter:</b> Fixed an issue where BitmapExtend=1 would not increase the meters width and/or height, which would cause the meter to ignore DynamicWindowSize and draw outside its bounds and possibly truncate outside the skin window.</li>
