<h2>Rainmeter 4.1</h2>
<div class="content clearfix">

<p>The following are the changes for the 4.1 beta version of Rainmeter.  You can safely install the new 4.1 beta version right over top of your existing Rainmeter 4.0 or earlier installation, and nothing you have done will be lost or changed. There is never any need to uninstall any earlier version of Rainmeter to use the newest version.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>As of Rainmeter 4.0, Windows XP and Windows Vista are no longer supported by the application.</p>
<p>Rainmeter 4.0 and later require at least Windows 7 with <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-windows-7-service-pack-1">Service Pack 1</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36805">Platform Update</a> applied. These should have been automatically applied several years ago by Windows Update, but if you have Windows Update turned off you may need to get and apply these updates manually. Windows versions later than Windows 7 are fully supported.</p>
<p>If you are on Windows XP or Windows Vista, and can't or don't wish to upgrade, you will need to stay on the 3.3 Release version of Rainmeter.</p>

<p><b>September 11, 2017 - Revision 2873</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Variables: Added Character Reference Variables to allow plain-text coding of Unicode characters and symbols, as well as icons from specialized fonts like FontAwesome.

<li><b>Changed</b> About Dialog: Major improvements to the Skins panel. Now shows both the "number" and "string" value of measures, and indicates when a measure is either disabled, paused, or both. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/user-interface/about/#SkinsTab">Skins Tab</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> PCRE: Added UCP support to the regular expression library, to enable \X \P \p in expressions.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Plugin API: Made some updates and corrections to the Rainmeter Plugin API. Plugin authors should re-based or download the current <a href="https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter-plugin-sdk">Rainmeter Plugin SDK</a>.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> NowPlaying: Corrected a long-standing problem with NowPlaying not reacting properly to changes in the state of "shuffle" and "repeat" in iTunes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>August 24, 2017 - Revision 2858</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Lua Scripting: Corrected an issue where in some cases retrieving a variable with Inline Lua could crash Rainmeter.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Rainmeter: Corrected an issue where "escaped" nested variables were not being parsed correctly. The syntax for escaping a nested variable is <code>[#*VarName*]</code> and <code>[&*MeasureName*]</code></li>
</ul>

<p><b>August 23, 2017 - Revision 2851</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Lua Scripting: Added inline Lua section variables, to support an inline return of a value from Lua with a function() call or by retrieving a variable. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/lua-scripting/inline-lua/">Inline Lua</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Rainmeter: Added an alternative nesting variables syntax, to enable nesting variables, section variables, and mouse variables inside each other. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/variables/nesting-variables/">Nesting Variables</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Net measures: Added a new <code>UseBits</code> option to return the value of NetIn / NetOut / NetTotal measures in bits rather than the default bytes.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> AudioLevel: Increased the size of the buffer for DeviceList from 512 to 4096.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Languages: Updated the ChineseTraditional language.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>July 28, 2017 - Revision 2838</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Changed</b> Lua Scripting: Due to recent changes made in how each Lua script maintains its own distinct state in the Rainmeter environment, we have been able to add the debug, setfenv, getfenv and coroutine functionality back into the Lua package.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Skin Installer: Fixed an issue where in some cases .rmskin names or path names in the .rmskin or on the installing computer could cause the installation to fail with Unicode characters. This was due to a problem in an ancient ZIP library being used, and has been updated.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>July 7, 2017 - Revision 2824</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Rainmeter: Drag Groups can now be created by selecting skins while holding CTRL-ALT, and dragging one skin, or nudging with the arrow keys will move all selected skins. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/arranging-skins/#Multiple">Multiple Skins</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Formulas: Corrected a missing BitwiseXOR formula operator.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>July 1, 2017 - Revision 2822</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Languages: Corrected an encoding problem with the Russian language.</li>
</ul>

Opens the current or a specified skin .ini file in the text editor defined in <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/settings/rainmeter-section/#ConfigEditor">ConfigEditor</a> in the Rainmeter settings, or associated with .ini files in Windows. The default will be Windows Notepad.exe.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Built-in variables: New <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/variables/built-in-variables/#CONFIGEDITOR">#CONFIGEDITOR#</a> variable. The path and executable for the text editor defined in <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/settings/rainmeter-section/#ConfigEditor">ConfigEditor</a> in Rainmeter settings, or the text editor associated with .ini files in Windows. The default will be Windows Notepad.exe.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Rainmeter: When dragging skins, temporarily enable the 'Show window contents while dragging' system option if disabled in Windows, to allow skins to draw during dragging and use the snapping feature.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>June 24, 2017 - Revision 2815</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Changed</b> NowPlaying: For Spotify, the artist and song text is obtained from the Windows titlebar of the Spotify application. Spotify used to prefix the text with "Spotify - ", but they don't anymore. The change to NowPlaying for Spotify fixes that. For iTunes, the change allows the album art to be retrieved for streaming songs as well as of local only songs.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Languages: Updated Dutch, Russian and Swedish translations.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Corrected a bug introduced in a previous beta that broke some features of the stroke style, like <code>StrokeLineJoin</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>June 7, 2017 - Revision 2807</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Corrected a bug introduced in r2806 that caused transform modifiers on Path shapes to be invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>June 1, 2017 - Revision 2806</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Bangs: Added new !FadeDuration and !FadeDurationGroup bangs to set the <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/settings/skin-sections/#FadeDuration">FadeDuration</a> in milliseconds when activating/deactivating a skin, using the fade-in / fade-out effects on mouse over, or when the <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/bangs/#ShowHideToggleFade">fade bangs</a> are used.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> NowPlaying: Changed the measure values for Progress and SetPosition to use floating point numbers instead of integers for increased accuracy.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Corrected a possible crash or unexpected behavior when Combined shapes were defined before their component shapes in the meter. The order of the options in the meter are now of no consequence, as it is with all other meter and measure options.</li> 
</ul>

<p><b>May 10, 2017 - Revision 2793</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> Formulas: Added new <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/formulas/#Functions">Deg</a> math function to convert radians to degrees.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Fix invalid radial gradient on combined shapes.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Installer: Fixed Rainmeter installer to support Windows Server 2008 R2, which is functionally analogous to Windows 7.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>April 21, 2017 - Revision 2787</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added</b> String meter: Added new <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/string/#FontWeight">FontWeight</a> option.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> Shape meter: Added Path1 alternative of the Path shape. It will use a different form of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#FillProperties">SVG fill-rule</a> when the shape is filled with a color or gradient. This determines what parts of a shape with intersecting segments are "inside" the shape and what are "outside", for purposes of filling the shape with the defined color or gradient. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/shape/#Path1">Path1 shape</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Added</b> CoreTemp plugin: The author of both the <a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/">CoreTemp application</a> and Rainmeter plugin, Arthur Liberman, added CPU core-specific values to the data available in the plugin. See <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/plugins/coretemp/">CoreTemp plugin</a> for details.</li>
<li><b>Changed</b> Bitmap meter: Changed the allowable measure value when <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/bitmap/#BitmapExtend">BitmapExtend=1</a> from a C-language int data type (2,147,483,647 maximum) to int64 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807 maximum).</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Bangs: Fixed an issue when the config parameter of a bang contained a leading or trailing slash.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> InputText plugin: Fixed a possible Rainmeter crash if an input box is open and the skin is deactivated.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Fixed a possible Rainmeter crash if the starting point of a Path shape was invalid.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Bitmap meter: Fixed an issue where BitmapExtend=1 would not increase the meters width and/or height, which would cause the meter to ignore DynamicWindowSize and draw outside its bounds and possibly truncate outside the skin window.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Bitmap meter: Fixed an issue where the <a href="https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/meters/general-options/#Padding">Padding</a> height values on the meter would be ignored in some situations.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> InlineSetting: Corrected an issue where Rainmeter could crash in some cases when an initial empty string was received by a meter using InlineSetting.</li>
<li><b>Fixed</b> Shape meter: Fixed an issue where certain gradients would not display correctly if there were multiple gradients in a shape meter.</li>
